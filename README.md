# Philosopher
***

## This is my Project Philosopher for the 42 school


### Here is the global ideas of th programe:


One or more philosophers sit at a round table:


* The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

* There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

* Philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

* The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

* Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

* Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

* Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

* Philosophers should avoid dying
